# Requirements

Always put Mmbase.sty in the root folder of .tex files (it's a package that I'll use often).

# Current State

â€¢ Mmbase.sty : (short for Mathieu math base), include shortcuts for writting classic math symbols (such as \mathbb{R}) and other handy symbols that are outlined in the file itself ; it also contains every package I found usefull to have.

â€¢ TD.cls : a class (lookup on Google how to use one in your one .tex) that normalize the style I want my tutorials (Travaux DirigÃ©s in French) to look like.

â€¢ TD folder : regroup tutorials examples I've created.

â€¢ Other folders are self-explanatory.


# Future Developments


â€¢ Have custom beamer template [ ðŸš§ <span style="color:blue">In Porgress</span>]

â€¢ Create a practical-style class.
