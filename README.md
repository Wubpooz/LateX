# Requirements

Always put Mmbase.sty in the root folder of .tex files (it's a package that I'll use often).

# Current State

• Mmbase.sty : (short for Mathieu math base), include shortcuts for writting classic math symbols (such as \mathbb{R}) and other handy symbols that are outlined in the file itself ; it also contains every package I found usefull to have.

• TD.cls : a class (lookup on Google how to use one in your one .tex) that normalize the style I want my tutorials (Travaux Dirigés in French) to look like.

• TD folder : regroup tutorials examples I've created.

• Other folders are self-explanatory.


# Future Developments


• Have custom beamer template **[<span style="color:blue;">In Progress</span>]** <span style="color:blue">some *blue* text</span>.

• Create a practical-style class.
