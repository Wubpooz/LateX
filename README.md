# Requirements

Always put Mmbase.sty in the root folder of .tex files (it's a package that I'll use often).

# Current State

• [`Mmbase.sty`](https://github.com/Wubpooz/LateX/blob/main/Packages%26Classes/Mmbase.sty) : (short for Mathieu math base), include shortcuts for writting classic math symbols (such as \mathbb{R}) and other handy symbols that are outlined in the file itself ; it also contains every package I found usefull to have.

• [`base.cls`](https://github.com/Wubpooz/LateX/blob/main/Packages%26Classes/base.cls) : my baseline class based on the article class with header/footer rulers, section name in the header and page number in the footer + some packages and styling options included. (To use, lookup on Google how to use a custom class in LateX)

• [`TD.cls`](https://github.com/Wubpooz/LateX/blob/main/Packages%26Classes/TDs.cls) : a class that normalize the style I want my tutorials (Travaux Dirigés in French) to look like.

• [`Saclay Beamer Template`](https://github.com/Wubpooz/LateX/tree/main/Packages%26Classes/Beamer_Saclay).

• [TD folder](https://github.com/Wubpooz/LateX/tree/main/TDs) : regroup tutorials examples I've created.

• Other folders are self-explanatory.


# Future Developments

• Create a practical-style class.
